Welcome to my amazing, incredible, and unstoppable Marvel web app. The purpose of this app is to play around with Marvel's API and design a stylish website. Oh yeah, and to have a blast while doing it!

Things to know:
  - This was built using Ruby on Rails 4.2.1 and Ruby 2.0.0p576
  - I made ample use of the AWESOME Ink CSS framework
  - PostgreSQL is my database of choice
  - Notable gems:
    - Nokogiri and mechanize for website scraping (Marvel's API has holes)
    - html_truncator for cutting down some of the larger character biographies
    - will_paginate for the pagination used on the index page's endless scrolling feature
